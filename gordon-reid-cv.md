### Computing Science MSci (Hons) 1st Class

As part of the degree programme, I had two individual projects. The first involved parallelising a document filtering system accelerated using OpenCL allowing the system to make best use of the hardware available on heterogeneous systems. The second involved working towards parallelisation and model coupling of existing Fortran simulations with a long term goal of automating as much of the work as possible.
