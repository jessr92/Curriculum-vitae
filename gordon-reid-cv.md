# Work Experience

## August 2015 to Present - Amazon

### Inherent Relationships

**May 2017 to Present - Software Development Engineer 2**

The core of the work on this team involved developing on and supporting a large scale data pipeline focused on the
publication and management of relationships that back many of the core features of the Amazon retail experience.

I also directly worked with various other teams across the company in their development efforts for solving crucial and
time-sensitive business problems.

I have also acted as point of contact for several teams to advise and assist with onboarding and integrating with core
business infrastructure to simplify cross-team engagement.

A core theme throughout has been operating with frugality mindset to ensure efficient use of developer time and compute
resources.

# Education

## 2010-2015 - University of Glasgow

### Computing Science MSci (Hons) 1st Class

As part of the degree programme, I had two individual projects. The first involved parallelising a document filtering
system accelerated using OpenCL allowing the system to make best use of the hardware available on heterogeneous systems.
The second involved working towards parallelisation and model coupling of existing Fortran simulations with a long term
goal of automating as much of the work as possible.

### Awards
