## Work Experience

### August 2015 to Present - Amazon

#### Inherent Relationships

**May 2017 to Present - Software Development Engineer 2**

The core of my work involved developing and supporting an Amazon catalog scale data pipeline focused on the
publication and management of relationships that back many of the features of the Amazon retail experience. I also directly
mentored intern and permanent software developers.

The primary technologies involved were AWS services such as EMR, DynamoDB, RDS, SQS, SNS with implementation written
in Java (including migrations from 8 to 11 to 17) with Typescript for infrastructure management. All services have CI/CD
with team-level ownership of all operational responsibilities.

I was also point of contact for internationally located teams in their development efforts for solving crucial and time-sensitive
business problems. I also advised and assisted with onboarding and integrating with core business infrastructure to simplify
cross-team engagement. I have also been involved in inter-year and next-year planning cycles, influencing team direction.

A core theme throughout has been operating with frugality mindset to ensure efficient use of developer time, auditor time,
and compute resources while also ensuring compliance with global data privacy requirements such as Data Subject Access
Request and On Demand Data Deletion.

#### Dynamic Merchandising

**April 2017 to May 2017 - Software Development Engineer 2**

**August 2015 to April 2017 - Software Development Engineer 1**

**June 2014 to August 2014 - Software Development Engineer Intern**

I have worked on numerous systems from design, development, and operational perspectives of a self-service graphic
creation web tool making use of various web technologies, a large scale metadata aggregator and widget renderer in Scala and
Java, and a personalised recommendations system displaying content to Amazon retail customers.

## Education

### 2010-2015 - University of Glasgow

#### Computing Science MSci (Hons) 1st Class

As part of the degree programme, I had two individual projects. The first involved parallelising a document filtering
system accelerated using OpenCL allowing the system to make best use of the hardware available on heterogeneous systems.
The second involved working towards parallelisation and model coupling of existing Fortran simulations with a long term
goal of automating as much of the work as possible.

#### Awards

* June 2014 - BCS Prize for the project with the best evaluation
* Class prizes for years 2, 3, 4, and 5.
